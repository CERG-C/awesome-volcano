# Contributing guidelines

Feel free to contribute to this list, but please follow these guidelines:

- Each contribution should be formatted as  `Title` - `Description` (`Reference`), where:
  - `Title` is name of the contribution and should contain a link to the resource.
  - `Description` is a short and simple, but descriptive insight into the resource.
  - `Reference` points to the reference paper/report/website.
- Respect the punctuation: add a hyphen after `Title` and a dot at the end of the entry.
- Double check your spelling and grammar!
- Adding new categories, or improving existing categories is welcome.
- Keep entries and categories sorts alphabetically by the title. The one exception to the rule are the *Miscellaneous* sections, which should be last.
